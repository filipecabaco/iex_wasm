cat <<'MOTD'

  Supabase's local stack, running natively in this machine: Postgres, PostgREST and Auth.
  notes is a small app on it, run by Bun: Auth for users, the Data API for notes, row level
  security keeping each user's notes their own. Try:

    notes signup ada@example.com lovelace-1815
    notes add first program, for the analytical engine
    notes search engine
    notes ls
    notes signup grace@example.com hopper-1906 && notes ls     # Grace can't see Ada's notes
    psql "$DB_URL" -c "select email from auth.users"
    sb-auth "$API_URL/rest/v1/notes" | jq                     # the service role sees them all
    supabase stack status
