#!no-fold-case

;; Note for developers: This module intentionally avoids using
;; Gauche's convenience features and extended libraries; instead,
;; we stick to the minimal primitives here as much as possible.
;; It's because this module is used to test the convenience
;; features and extended libraries.

;; Writing your own test
;;
;;  (use gauche.test)
;;  (test-start "my feature")
;;  (load "my-feature")         ; load your program
;;  (select-module my-feature)  ; if your program defines a module.
;;
;;  (test-module 'my-feature)   ; checks if module binding is sane
;;
;;  (test-section "feature group 1")
;;  (test "feature 1-1" EXPECT (lambda () TEST-BODY))
;;  (test "feature 1-2" EXPECT (lambda () TEST-BODY))
;;  ...
;;
;;  (test-section "feature group 2")
;;  (define test-data ...)
;;  (test "feature 2-1" EXPECT (lambda () TEST-BODY))
;;  ...
;;
;;  (test-end)
;;
;; To run a test interactively, just load the file.
;; It is also recommended to have a "test" target in your Makefile, so that
;; the user of your program can run a test easily.  The rule may look like
;; this:
;;
;;   test :
;;        gosh my-feature-test.scm > test.log
;;
;; If stdout is redirected to other than tty, all the verbose logs will go
;; there, and only a small amount of messages go to stderr.
;;
;; Some environment variables affect the behavior of the tests.
;;
;;  GAUCHE_TEST_REPORT_ERROR  If defined, reports stack trace to stderr
;;         when the test thunk raises an error (even when it is expected).
;;         Useful for diagnosis of unexpected errors.
;;
;;  GAUCHE_TEST_RECORD_FILE   If defined, names a file the test processes
;;         keep the total statistics.  Test-end accumulates the stats
;;         into the named file instead of reporting it out immediately.
