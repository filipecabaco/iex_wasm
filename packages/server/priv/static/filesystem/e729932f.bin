;; We expand require-extension into cond-expand, which will
;; load and imports required features if necessary.
;; (This depends on the fact that Gauche's cond-expand has an effect
;; after the form).
;;
;; An important extension from the plain cond-expand is that
;; if we can't cond-expand to srfi-N, we look for the module
;; srfi-N from the current load path.
