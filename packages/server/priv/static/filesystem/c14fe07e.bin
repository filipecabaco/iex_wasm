;; [SK] the srfi-7 reference implementation using cond-expand expands
;; a form that ends with (begin), although the empty begin isn't defined
;; in R5RS.
;; Gauche usually compiles (begin) into a code that does nothing.
;; However, if there's a form like (begin <constant> (begin)), Gauche's
;; compiler optimizer removes <constant> as well.
;; A user might be surprised when he finds (program (code 4))
;; returns #<undef> ---but note that 'program' form isn't an expression
;; anyway, so expecting its result is beyond the scope of srfi-7.
