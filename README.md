# snowglobe

**Package a Docker image into a website that runs it in the browser.** snowglobe boots your
image on real Linux inside [armless](https://github.com/filipecabaco/armless), a 64-bit ARM
machine compiled to WebAssembly, snapshots it once your app is ready, and writes a folder of
static files. Visitors
get your program running in their tab in about a second, with no server behind it.

**[▶ Try the demos](https://filipecabaco.github.io/snowglobe/)**: Supabase (its native stack and a small app on it), Elixir IEx, PostgreSQL, Elixir + Postgres, Python + Rich, TypeScript + Zod,
Go + Bubble Tea, Rust + clap, Java + Gson, and curl + jq (plain Alpine tools, online through your browser), each a small
project in [`examples/`](examples) running in the browser.

[![CI and Pages](https://github.com/filipecabaco/snowglobe/actions/workflows/pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/filipecabaco/snowglobe/actions/workflows/pages.yml)

```sh
snowglobe build ./my-app          # a directory with a Dockerfile, or any image reference
snowglobe serve dist              # preview at http://localhost:8000, then deploy dist/ anywhere
snowglobe pool sites              # several sites under one host share a single blob store
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experiment. Everything runs on an emulated 64-bit ARM CPU (translated to WebAssembly as
> it runs), so expect it to be slower than native. A site can have up to 8 CPUs (`--cpus`), which
> helps programs that use them (the Elixir demo runs CPU-bound tasks about 4× faster on 4); the
> demos use 2, to stay light on phones.

## What you need

- **Docker.** That's all the host needs: the snapshot step runs in a build container.
- **An arm64 Alpine image**: `FROM alpine` (multi-arch; snowglobe builds it for arm64) or
  `FROM arm64v8/alpine`. Alpine is the distro snowglobe knows how to make bootable. On an x86
  host, Docker needs QEMU's binfmt handlers to build arm64 images (Docker Desktop has them; on
  Linux: `docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install arm64`).

Install a binary for Linux or macOS (amd64 or arm64) from the
[releases](https://github.com/filipecabaco/snowglobe/releases), or with Go 1.27+:

```sh
go install github.com/filipecabaco/snowglobe/cmd/snowglobe@latest
```

The first build fetches the tools image (the machine that boots and snapshots your image) from
`ghcr.io/filipecabaco/snowglobe-tools`. For a version that hasn't been released yet, it is
compiled locally instead, which takes a few minutes once. Set `SNOWGLOBE_TOOLS_BUILD=1` to
always compile it locally.

## Your image, in a tab

Whatever the image runs (its `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD`, with its `ENV` and `WORKDIR`) appears in a
terminal in the page. The Python demo is this Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.24.2
RUN apk add --no-cache python3
CMD ["python3"]
LABEL snowglobe.title="Python in the browser" \
      snowglobe.ready=">>> " \
      snowglobe.exercise='["import json, re, collections", "import asyncio; asyncio.run(asyncio.sleep(0))"]'
```

| Flag | Label | Default |
|------|-------|---------|
| `--out DIR` | | `dist` |
| `--cmd CMD` | | the image's `ENTRYPOINT` + `CMD` |
| `--ready TEXT` | `snowglobe.ready` | snapshot once the terminal has been quiet for 5 s |
| `--title TEXT` | `snowglobe.title` | the source |
| `--memory MB` | `snowglobe.memory` | `512` |
| `--exercise CMD` (repeatable) | `snowglobe.exercise` (JSON array) | none |
| `--warm REGEX` | `snowglobe.warm` | none |
| `--network fetch` | `snowglobe.network` | `none` |
| `--tunnel [HOST:]PORT=URL` (repeatable) | `snowglobe.tunnels` (JSON array) | none |
| `--tunnel-token URL` | `snowglobe.tunnel-token` | none |
| `--allow-private` | | off |
| `--cpus N` (1–8) | `snowglobe.cpus` | `1` |
| `--no-chunks` | | off |

Labels let a Dockerfile describe itself; flags override them. `--cmd` swaps the program without
touching the image, and drops the image's `ready` and `exercise` labels, which belonged to its
own command.

With `--cpus 2` or more, each guest CPU runs in its own Web Worker on shared memory. Browsers only
allow that on a cross-origin isolated page, which a static host can't declare, so the site ships a
small service worker that adds the headers and reloads the page once on the first visit.

## Networking

Guests have no network unless you ask for it. With `--network fetch` (or
`LABEL snowglobe.network="fetch"`), the guest gets a virtio NIC and DHCP, and every request it
makes leaves as the page's own browser request. There is still no server. The guest's connections
to ports 80 and 443 end inside the machine, in armless's web relay:

- **HTTP** (port 80): each request becomes a `fetch()`.
- **HTTPS** (port 443) is terminated in the machine by a small TLS 1.3 server. It presents a
  certificate for the requested host, signed by a CA made fresh for each build, and the request
  inside is replayed with `fetch("https://…")`. The guest trusts that CA (the system bundle, plus
  `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` and Java's `cacerts`). Nothing else
  should, since its key ships with the site.
- **WebSockets** (`wss://` and `ws://`): the guest's upgrade request opens a browser `WebSocket` to
  the same URL, and messages pass through both ways.

```console
/ # curl -sS https://api.github.com/zen
Approachable is better than simple.
/ # wscat -c wss://echo.websocket.org
Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
> hello from wscat in a browser tab
< hello from wscat in a browser tab
```

The browser's rules still apply: HTTP(S) only reaches servers that allow CORS (example.com doesn't,
so the guest gets a 502 that says so), UDP goes nowhere, other TCP only through a tunnel (below),
and TLS is 1.3 with X25519/P-256 and AES-128-GCM, which every current client offers. The
TypeScript demo uses all of it: Zod validating a live GitHub API response, and a WebSocket echo.

### Other TCP: tunnels

A page can't open raw TCP, so a guest's connection to a database, Redis or any port but 80 and 443
is refused, unless the site names it as a **tunnel**: `--tunnel HOST:PORT=URL` carries every
connection the guest opens to `HOST:PORT` (any name on `PORT`, if `HOST` is left out) over a
WebSocket to `URL`, the stream's bytes sent as binary messages. That is what websockify, websocat
and Neon's wsproxy speak, so any of them in front of the service is the other end:

```console
$ websocat --binary ws-l:0.0.0.0:6543 tcp:127.0.0.1:5432     # next to Postgres
$ snowglobe build ./my-app --network fetch --tunnel db.internal:5432=wss://db-proxy.example.com/
```

The guest connects to `db.internal:5432` as usual; no change to the app. `snowglobe run` and the
build's snapshot carry tunnels the same way, from the host. Tunnelled connections that stay open
while the app idles (a connection pool, a `LISTEN`) don't count as the app being busy.

**Credentials.** Whatever the guest knows ships with the site: a database password in its
environment is in the snapshot, for every visitor. Instead, put `{token}` in the tunnel URL and
name a token endpoint with `--tunnel-token URL`: the page asks it (`GET`, answering with the token
as plain text) for a fresh one on every connection, and a gateway behind the tunnel checks the
token and holds the real credentials (pgbouncer logging in upstream itself, an S3 proxy signing
requests again). Natively, `build` and `run` fetch one token per boot. A token only replaces the
password; what it opens is whatever the gateway lets any visitor do.

The build's snapshot (and `snowglobe run`) refuse loopback and private addresses, so a guest can't
reach the host's own services; `--allow-private` lets them, for a tunnel endpoint on your own
machine while developing. The page is unaffected.

## Install it as an app

`snowglobe pwa dist/python` makes a built site a Progressive Web App: a manifest and icons, and a
service worker that caches the page, the machine and every file the run fetched, so it installs
to a home screen or dock and keeps working offline once it has run. Chromium shows an
**Install app** button in the status strip; on iOS, use Share → Add to Home Screen. A new build
gets a new cache. Run it after `snowglobe pool`; every demo on the live site is installable.

## Keep your workspace

Every newly built run remembers your work locally. The save bar always shows the **save
location**, **last-save time**, **current activity**, and **Save now**. **Save / restore** opens
an overlay without shrinking the terminal. Saves include the whole emulated machine—RAM,
processes and guest-written files—plus the terminal replay. This preserves TypeScript REPL
variables as well as Supabase's database and running services. No checkpoint is sent to a server.

The menu offers three clearly separated methods:

- **Browser — automatic** is the default: no setup, just Save now. Saves stay in this browser.
- **Backup file** lets you choose a filename and download or restore a `.snowglobe` file.
  This is an extra portable copy, not a change of automatic-save location. Autosave never updates
  a downloaded backup file. The browser handles the actual download and any existing filename.
  Restored backups are validated and become separate workspaces rather than overwriting existing
  ones. Backups may contain passwords, tokens, database contents and other guest memory; they are
  not encrypted. Keep them private and restore only files you trust.
- **Folder — automatic** is available on browsers with `showDirectoryPicker()` (principally
  desktop Chrome/Edge), and greyed out otherwise. Choose a folder; the save bar shows its name
  and dedicated `snowglobe-…` subdirectory. Browsers do not expose the full OS path. Two alternating
  files retain the previous valid save if a write fails or the newest file is corrupt. This is
  **session-bundle storage**, not a live guest filesystem mount. Reopening may require **Reconnect
  folder** permission. Switching storage copies current work and keeps old saves. A failed folder
  mount never silently switches to browser storage; choosing Browser offers an explicit switch.

Autosave defaults to **1 minute** while the page is visible. Its menu control also offers
**5 minutes**, **15 minutes**, and **Off — Save now only**; the preference survives refreshes and
storage changes. Expensive captures lengthen the interval. During capture, an overlay and status
say **Terminal briefly paused** and prevent input. The guest then resumes, the overlay disappears,
and compression/writing display **You can keep working. Keep this tab open until finished.**
The busy indicator remains until the checkpoint is committed (or an error is reported).

Refresh resumes the **last completed save**, not necessarily the latest changes. There is no
reliable unload-time save. Before leaving important work, use the visible **Save now** button
and wait for completion. **Unsaved changes** reflects observed input/terminal activity; it is a
conservative indicator, not proof that background processes haven't changed machine state. New
activity during compression/writing remains marked as unsaved after that checkpoint commits.

**Saved workspaces** groups opening previous saves, **Start fresh…**, named workspace creation,
and explicit deletion. Selecting a workspace does not open it until **Open selected workspace…**
is pressed and confirmed. Starting fresh retains previous saves; only **Delete this saved
workspace…** removes one. **Recovery** separately offers a reload that preserves saved work.
Firefox/Safari can use browser storage and backup download/restore.

Browser storage survives ordinary refreshes but is subject to quota, site-data clearing and
possible eviction. The page requests persistent storage when supported; the browser can refuse.
Checkpoint-write failures are shown, never reported as successful saves. A second tab on the
same demo opens a temporary run rather than competing for the saved sessions; it can export a
backup. Web Locks are required for automatic saving. Folder locking is local to this origin and
browser profile: do not write the same session folder concurrently from different browsers.

Checkpoints are tied to the exact base snapshot, filesystem, runtime and machine configuration.
After an incompatible rebuild, older sessions are **kept for export**, not silently restored or
replaced. Backups do not include the runtime or all original filesystem blobs: retain the
original built site and its blob store if you need to restore those sessions later. This is
checkpoint persistence, not a continuously durable Postgres volume or a database backup service.
External HTTP/WebSocket connections may need reconnecting after restore. Capturing large guests
uses additional memory and can briefly freeze the UI, especially on mobile devices.

## Share a run as a post

Every demo has an X player card at `card/<demo>/` (e.g.
[filipecabaco.github.io/snowglobe/card/elixir/](https://filipecabaco.github.io/snowglobe/card/elixir/)):
shared on X, the post itself boots the run in a 480×480 frame, and the link opens the demo page.
`elixir assets/cards.exs` writes the card pages and poster sources from `assets/cards.json`, where
each poster's lines are real output from that run; capture each poster at 480×480 into
`site/card/<demo>/poster.png`. X caches cards for about a week, so re-share with a new query string
after changing one.

The frame inside a post can't be cross-origin isolated, so a card can only boot a one-CPU run. A
demo on several CPUs gets a one-CPU build for its card: `supabase-1cpu` in `DEMOS` is
`examples/supabase` built with `--cpus 1` (any `<example>-<n>cpu` works), and the card's `player`
in `assets/cards.json` names it.

## Running a site headlessly

A built site also runs without a browser, in a sandboxed container: the same snapshot, restored
by armless natively (`snowglobe-vm`, in Rust), with its app console on your terminal. The guest is
an emulated machine with no access to the host, and the container around it runs unprivileged,
read-only, memory-capped and offline unless the site was built with `--network fetch`.

Natively, armless compiles hot guest code to host code (its native JIT), when booting and
snapshotting a site at build time as well as when running one: about 2–3× faster on CPU-bound work
than its interpreter. `ARMLESS_JIT=off` keeps the interpreter. A host that can't run generated code
stays interpreted on its own.

With a network, the guest goes out the way your machine does. The same web relay makes its HTTP(S)
and WebSocket requests, other TCP connections are made for it, and private addresses are off
limits. If `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY` or `NO_PROXY` are set, they go to the container, and so does
`SSL_CERT_FILE`. That covers sandboxes whose only way out is a TLS-intercepting proxy.

```console
$ snowglobe run dist/elixir                 # a session; ctrl-] quits
$ printf 'Enum.sum(1..100)\n' | snowglobe run dist/elixir
5050

$ snowglobe run dist/elixir --name pg --detach
$ snowglobe exec pg 'sql "CREATE TABLE notes (body text)"'
$ snowglobe exec pg "sql \"INSERT INTO notes VALUES ('from snowglobe exec')\""
$ snowglobe exec pg 'sql "SELECT * FROM notes"'
body
───────────────────
from snowglobe exec
1 row(s)
$ snowglobe attach pg                       # join it; ctrl-] detaches, it keeps running
$ snowglobe ps
$ snowglobe stop pg
```

A site doesn't have to be local. `snowglobe run` also takes a deployed site's URL (any static
host or CDN: it mirrors what a run needs into a cache, the warm pack in one request) or a tarball,
local or by URL, made with `snowglobe pack`. Downloads happen on the host and are revalidated
(ETag or Last-Modified), so the second run starts from the cache and the sandbox stays offline:

```console
$ snowglobe run https://filipecabaco.github.io/snowglobe/python/
$ snowglobe pack dist/elixir -o elixir.tar.gz      # one self-contained file, pooled blobs included
$ snowglobe run https://cdn.example.com/elixir.tar.gz
```

`--tunnel` and `--tunnel-token` replace the site's own tunnels for a run (a local proxy, say), and
`--allow-private` lets them reach this machine.

A site built with `--network fetch` can also serve: `-p HOST:GUEST` forwards a port on your machine
to a port in the guest, through the same virtual network its own requests use. Host ports bind to
127.0.0.1 unless you give an address (`-p 0.0.0.0:8080:4000`):

```console
$ snowglobe run dist/typescript --name web --detach -p 4000:4000
$ snowglobe exec web 'const http = await import("node:http"); http.createServer((req, res) => res.end("hello\n")).listen(4000)'
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:4000/
hello
```

Piped stdin is typed in one line at a time, each waiting until the app goes quiet. `exec` prints
only what the command printed (no echo, no prompt) and plain text when its output isn't a
terminal, which suits scripts and agents. Each instance starts fresh from the snapshot.

### Supabase, and packages from Alpine

Two examples go further:

- **[`supabase`](examples/supabase)** (on the demo site) runs the Supabase CLI's native local stack
  (Postgres, PostgREST and Auth as plain processes, no Docker) inside the guest, on 2 CPUs, with
  `notes`, a small app on it (90 lines of TypeScript): users sign up through Auth, notes are
  stored and searched through the Data API, and row level security keeps each user's notes their
  own. It runs on the Bun inside the Supabase CLI (`BUN_BE_BUN=1`), so the image carries no Node,
  and a command takes well under a second. The stack's services are glibc programs, so the image
  carries Debian's glibc next to Alpine's musl, and Postgres extensions the demo never loads
  (Wrappers, PostGIS, PL/Perl, PGroonga) are left out.
- **[`apk`](examples/apk)** installs Alpine packages into the running machine (`apk add figlet`).
  Alpine's mirrors don't allow CORS, so this only works under `snowglobe run`, where the guest's
  requests go out from the host; CI builds and checks it, but it isn't on the demo site.

```console
$ snowglobe build examples/supabase --out dist/supabase
$ snowglobe run dist/supabase
supa:~/app$ notes signup ada@example.com lovelace-1815
signed in as ada@example.com (0941bc18)
supa:~/app$ notes add first program, for the analytical engine
#1 added
supa:~/app$ notes signup grace@example.com hopper-1906 && notes ls
signed in as grace@example.com (66973d17)
grace@example.com: 0 note(s)
```

## Development checks

Run `go test ./...`, `node --test internal/site/sessions.test.cjs` and `node --test
bench/lib.test.mjs bench/server.test.mjs` (Node 22+; no npm packages needed), or `mise run test`. To exercise real IndexedDB transactions, Web Locks and filesystem
writable streams, serve the repository on localhost and open
`internal/site/sessions.browser.html` in a visible tab; its results are displayed on the page.
The automatic-saving check requires the tab to remain visible, just like the demos. Full session
restore should also be checked against a built demo, since storage tests do not verify the VM.

## Benchmarks

`bench/` measures built sites end to end in Chromium (Playwright), the way visitors use them:

- **cold**: a first visit, in a fresh browser profile: the page opened until the terminal is live
  (the snapshot downloaded and restored, the screen replayed)
- **warm**: a repeat visit in the same profile, served by the service worker (saved workspaces
  are cleared first, so it restores the site's snapshot, not a save)
- **4G cold**: a first visit over a slower link (9 Mbit/s, +75 ms per request)
- **workload**: on the warm visit, each of the site's `exercise` commands typed in, timed until it
  has finished printing (its `ready` prompt is back, or the guest has gone quiet)

with what each visit downloaded, its requests and the page's JS heap. A local server stands in
for GitHub Pages (its caching headers; the throttling is done there, so the service worker's and
the CPU workers' requests are slowed too).

```sh
snowglobe build examples/python --out dist/python
snowglobe pwa dist/python          # the service worker the live demos have (warm visits use it)
(cd bench && npm ci)               # Playwright; then `npx playwright install chromium` once
node bench/run.mjs dist/python     # --reps 3 by default; bench-results/python.json + summary.md
```

Its options (repetitions, scenarios, the link's speed) are listed at the top of `bench/run.mjs`.
`node bench/report.mjs bench-results --baseline FILE` compares results with an earlier run's
(`node bench/report.mjs DIR --combine FILE` makes one).

In CI every site job benchmarks its site, and the `bench-report` job of the same run turns the
results into one report: in the run's summary and, on a pull request, in one comment updated by
each run. It leads with a verdict, then a table per demo of cold, warm, 4G cold and workload
(medians), with downloads, requests, each metric's min–max and per-command times folded
underneath, the commit measured and a link to the run.

Every run is also kept as a file on `refs/snowglobe/bench` (outside `refs/heads`, like the blob
store): `pr/<number>/<commit>.json` for a pull request, `main/<commit>.json` and
`main/latest.json` for main. The comment lists the pull request's earlier runs (each commit's
medians, per demo), and once main has a run, compares with main's latest: a change is flagged only
when no visit of the run overlaps main's (its min–max is clear of main's) and the medians differ
by 15% or more for times, 10% for counts and sizes. Two shared runners differ by up to ~13% on the
same build (every command a little slower on one), so read smaller changes as noise. To read the files:
`git fetch origin refs/snowglobe/bench && git show FETCH_HEAD:pr/16/<commit>.json`.

The numbers never fail CI; only a harness that can't measure does. A pull request from a fork has a
read-only token: its report stays in the run's summary, and its results aren't kept.

To measure an armless change, run "CI and Pages" by hand with `armless_ref` (a branch, tag or full
commit of armless): the tools image is built on it ([`bench/use-armless.sh`](bench/use-armless.sh):
snowglobe-vm and the browser runtime both from that commit), every site is rebuilt and
re-snapshotted on it, benchmarked and compared with main's latest, and nothing is deployed or kept.
Rebuilding matters: a snapshot carries the machine it was taken on (the guest reads the CPU's
features once, at boot), so swapping only armless.wasm under an old snapshot would not measure the
new one.

## The warm cache

The guest's files are fetched on demand: the first time the guest reads a file, it waits on one
HTTP request for it. To hide that, every site preloads a `warm.pack` in the background, and
snowglobe fills it by **measuring**, not guessing:

- **Boot reads:** every file the guest read while booting to the ready point. The snapshot is
  taken with the page cache dropped, so the app reads these again after a restore.
- **Exercise reads:** after the snapshot is saved, snowglobe types each `--exercise` command into
  the app and records what it reads. The guest is then exactly where a visitor's tab starts, so
  these are the files a visitor's first commands would otherwise wait for.
- **Pattern:** anything matching `--warm`, for files no exercise touches.

Each build prints a breakdown and writes `warm-report.json` (by phase and directory, in download
bytes). What the demos show:

| Demo | Boot | First commands | Never read | What dominates |
|------|-----:|---------------:|-----------:|----------------|
| Elixir + Postgres | 23.8 MB | 0 | 30.6 MB | a release in embedded mode loads every module at startup, and Postgres reads its catalog as it starts |
| Python + Rich | 8.3 MB | 0.1 MB | 43.5 MB | the startup file imports Rich, so its modules are boot reads |
| TypeScript + Zod | 25.6 MB | 3.8 MB | 29.1 MB | the `node` binary, then tsx/esbuild and Zod's modules on first use |
| Go + Bubble Tea | 5.4 MB | 0 | 25.1 MB | one static binary, read at boot |
| Rust + clap | 4.0 MB | 0.4 MB | 25.1 MB | `jtab` is read on first use; the shell is all that boots |
| Java + Gson | 48.2 MB | 0 | 115.4 MB | the JDK's `lib/modules` image, opened at boot |
| curl + jq | 4.1 MB | 2.3 MB | 24.9 MB | `curl`, its TLS and `jq` load on the first request |

**Warming from outside traffic.** Exercises are commands typed into the console. For an app that
is used over the network (an API under its own test suite, say), record what a run reads instead,
and add it to the warm pack:

```console
$ snowglobe run dist --name api --detach -p 5000:5000 --record-reads api-reads.json
$ npm test                                   # anything that talks to 127.0.0.1:5000
$ snowglobe stop api && snowglobe warm dist api-reads.json
Recorded 2 files: 0 new in the warm pack, now 254 files, 27.5 MB
```

`warm` keeps what the pack had and adds what's new, and updates `run.json`; it takes several
recordings at once. `warm-report.json` still describes the build's own phases.

Whatever a program loads lazily needs exercises to warm well (TypeScript's compile path, Zod,
first-use tools); whatever it loads up front (a release in embedded mode, a startup file's imports,
a single static binary, Java's module image) is captured by boot reads alone.

## Several sites, one host

`snowglobe pool <dir>` lets every site under a directory share one blob store. Blobs are named by
content hash (a large file's chunks too), so sites built on the same base (kernel, Alpine, the boot layer) share many: the six
language demos go from 715 MB to 544 MB, and a visitor's second demo reuses what their browser cached.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    I[your image<br/>arm64 Alpine] --> B[+ boot layer<br/>kernel, 9p initramfs]
    B -->|docker export| C[9p filesystem<br/>zstd blobs]
    C --> S[boot headless in armless<br/>snapshot when ready]
    S --> D[dist/<br/>static files]
```

1. **Boot layer.** snowglobe adds a kernel, an initramfs that mounts the root filesystem over 9p,
   OpenRC, and a terminal that runs your command, on top of your image.
2. **Filesystem.** `docker export` streams straight into snowglobe, which writes a 9p filesystem
   (v86's format, which armless reads): a JSON tree plus one zstd-compressed blob per unique file,
   fetched by the browser on demand. Files of 2 MiB and more are split into content-defined chunks
   (cut as armless's own image tools cut them), so a read fetches only the chunks it covers and
   sites share identical chunks even when the files around them differ; `--no-chunks` turns it off.
3. **Snapshot.** The guest boots headless in armless (natively, in the build container) until your
   app is ready, and the whole machine state is saved. Visitors restore it instead of booting Linux.
4. **Warm pack.** The files the guest read while booting and while being exercised are bundled
   into one `warm.pack` the page downloads in the background (see above).

## Develop

```sh
mise install       # Go, pinned in mise.toml
mise run test
mise run build     # build all ten demos into dist/ (a few minutes)
mise run serve
```

Pushing to `main` runs the tests and the same build in GitHub Actions, and deploys `dist/` to
GitHub Pages.

To release, change [`VERSION`](VERSION) in a pull request (`0.3.0`, or `0.3.0-rc.1` for a
prerelease). Once it's on `main`, [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) runs the same
checks, tags `v<VERSION>` on that commit, publishes the tools image and puts the binaries on a
GitHub release. A version that is tagged already releases nothing; pushing a tag by hand still
releases it as before.

## Credits

The machine is [armless](https://github.com/filipecabaco/armless), which started as a fork of
[v86](https://github.com/copy/v86) by Fabian Hemmer and contributors. snowglobe was built on v86
first, and its 9p filesystem format is v86's. The idea and early setup came from
[snaplet/postgres-wasm](https://github.com/snaplet/postgres-wasm) and
[iximiuz/docker-to-linux](https://github.com/iximiuz/docker-to-linux).

For agents, the site serves a plain-text summary of the CLI at
[filipecabaco.github.io/snowglobe/llms.txt](https://filipecabaco.github.io/snowglobe/llms.txt).
